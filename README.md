importantance of movement from ethereum to starknet

- bridges are essential in this transition - but maybe loss of funds which transfer or can't find better opportunity of 
- solution using storage api to prove - lending, locked assets bridging


We leverage tokenflow dashboards to get preliminary insights. Based on those we do thorough analysis using the voyerger API which gives us blockchain data.

Using this we make a recommendation system which shows the user when to bridge or which assets to buy on starknet.

Proof of the analysis will be given by the herodotus storage API.


## Possible prediction events

- blocks duration
- transactions volume delta change
- messages which can include bridging activity and other present on /analytics page


### Tech we plan to use


1. tokenflow - starknet datasets explorer
2. herodotus  - Submissions must demonstrate actual use of the Storage Proof API, without mock requests. Demonstrate actual use of the Storage Proof API (no mock requests)
3. voyerger api - want full focus - block explorer and analytics



Use tokenflow to analyse opportunities and use it to create something on the application which should be pay per use 


TODO

- [x] test using herodotus api
- [x] testing voyager api
- [x] determine unique ways of representing the data fetched by the apis
- [ ] use cairo contracts somehow? -  if required learn them
